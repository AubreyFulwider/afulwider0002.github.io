              <p class="text-primary">&nbsp;Adder Ridge was dicovered in 1867. It was discovered by a small family as they were digging a well. The cave was initially crawling with adders, hence the name. Since then, the cave has been cleared of the dangerous snakes and now
                serves as a popular tourist attraction in Nayer county.

                that have had hydrothermic activity.</p>

              <p class="">Calcite is a rock-froming mineral. It is very common and is nearly found anywhere. It is the main mineral in limestone and marble, which make up a huge portion of the Earth's crust. They serve as largest deposit of carbon on our planet if
                you looked at them as a whole.</p>

              <p class="text-light">Agate is formed in volcanic rock. Namely, the pockets that were one filled with air in lava or magma. As the pockets cooled so did the solutions inside, mostly made up of sillica and impurites. As the solution cooled it would form alternating
                bands of sillica then impure minerals to create the striped pattern of an agate. The pattern continued until there are no impurites left of the entire solution has cooled.</p>
